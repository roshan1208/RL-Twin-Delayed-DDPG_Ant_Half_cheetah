# RL-Twin-Delayed-DDPG_Ant_Half_cheetah

We used the  DDPG(TD-3) method using the actor-critic model to implement        
        deep Q-Learning in Continuous Action Space then we tested our code for    
        three different PyBullet Robotics Environments  as Half-Cheetah, Ant and 
        Half_Humanoid
